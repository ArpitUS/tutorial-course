# Module 8 â€“ Go Routines & Channels: Concurrency in Action

## OBJECTIVE

Understand how Go achieves concurrency using goroutines and channels.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

- Launch concurrent functions using goroutines.
- Use time.Sleep to manage concurrent execution flow.
- Understand basic synchronization concepts.
- Write concurrent programs that perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## ASSIGNMENT

- Create a folder named `module8_assignment`.
- Write a program that:
  - Launches two goroutines: one prints even numbers, another prints odd numbers.
  - Synchronizes the output using time.Sleep.
  - Prints "Program Completed" after both finish.
- Save, run, and screenshot your output.
