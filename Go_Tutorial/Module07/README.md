# Module 7 â€“ Interfaces & Polymorphism Made Simple

## OBJECTIVE

 Learn how to use interfaces to achieve polymorphism and write flexible, decoupled Go code.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

- Understand the concept of interfaces in Go.
- Implement interfaces using concrete types.
- Use polymorphism to handle different types with shared behavior.
- Write reusable functions that accept interfaces.

## ASSIGNMENT

- Create a folder named `module7_assignment`.
- Write a program that:
  - Defines an interface `Shape` with a method `Area() float64`.
  - Implements `Shape` for `Rectangle` and `Circle` structs.
  - Calculates and prints areas of both shapes.
- Save, run, and screenshot your output.
