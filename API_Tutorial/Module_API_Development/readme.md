# Module – API Development

## Objectives

- Understand what an API is and how it works
- Learn HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Create a simple REST API with endpoints
- Handle JSON request and response
- Test APIs using `curl` or `Postman`

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python or Go
- Understanding of functions and JSON

---

## Key Concepts

1. **API (Application Programming Interface):**
   - Defines how software components communicate
   - REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most common style

2. **HTTP Methods:**
   - `GET` → Retrieve data  
   - `POST` → Create data  
   - `PUT` → Update data  
   - `DELETE` → Remove data

3. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
   - A lightweight format for sending and receiving structured data

## Tasks

1. Create a simple REST API that serves user data
2. Implement routes for:
   - `GET /users`
   - `POST /users`
   - `GET /users/{id}`
   - `DELETE /users/{id}`
3. Return responses in JSON format
4. Test endpoints with `curl` or `Postman`
